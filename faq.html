      <em>If you're an archer who's never been on a horse ...</em> or only gone on a few trail rides while on vacation, we recommend taking a few horseback riding lessons in the ring with an instructor to make sure it's something you will enjoy and to which you can commit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>If you're an equestrian who's never shot an arrow ...</em> come to one of our ground archery practices! They'll be announced on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mounted-Archery/">Meetup Group</a>. We have a limited number of loaner bows and arrows for newbies — let us know if you're planning on attending so we know to bring them. Or, if the timing never quite works out, most of the ranges have their own instruction programs. They'll teach using modern techniques and equipment, which is a bit different, but it'll give you a taste.

    <a name="faq-join"></a>How can I join your club?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
	  If you are serious about practicing mounted archery, become a member of the <a href="http://www.mountedarchery.org">Mounted Archery Association of the Americas</a> (MA3). <a class="page-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">Contact us</a> directly so we know who you are or come to one of our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mounted-Archery/">Meetups</a> to meet us in person. When we find a ranch or stable at which we can practice regularly, we will be able to form an affiliate club of the MA3.

    <a name="faq-safety"></a>How safe is this?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Any sport involving over 1,000 pounds of prey animal has risk involved, but mounted archery is just as safe as any other equestrian discipline. If fact, we think it's safer! We practice safe archery and safe horsemanship. We shoot at stationary targets that are positioned out of harm's way. We desensitize the horses to the bow and arrows. When practicing archery from horseback, we start at the walk, then trot, then canter, only moving up in gait when we can safely do so.
    </p>

    <a name="faq-horse"></a>What breed of horse is best?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Any sound horse is suitable as long as you are a skillful rider and a dedicated archer.  Breed does not matter.  Some riders definitely prefer certain breeds for their temperament or abilities, but the truth is you can practice and compete in mounted archery on any breed of horse.

    <p>
      Traditional Asiatic recurve bows (composite bows) often called "horse bows" were designed for exactly this activity. Modern features such as sights, arrow-rests, pulleys, and pistol grips get in the way at the speeds a horse archer must knock, sight, and release. Plus a shorter bow (or an asymmetrical one like the Japanese yumi) tends to be easier to manage in the saddle. Official MA3 competitions require traditional bows.
    </p>

    <p>
      We shoot many arrows at relatively short distances, so high poundage bows are unnecessarily fatiguing even at the highest levels of the sport.
    </p>

    <p>
      To give you some specifics, here's what some of our current members use:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://horsebows.com/bows1.htm#Raven">Kassai Raven</a> (50# @ 30")</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ragim.org/product/traditional-and-hunting-bows/taïga">Ragim Taïga</a> (35# @ 28")</li>
        <li><a href="http://cinnabarbow.com/marinerbows/ming.html">Cinnabar Ming Moon 4 </a> (35# @ 31")</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
       
    <p>
      <em>If you're just starting out with archery...</em> For children and adults not yet used to drawing a bow, here are two affordable bows to consider:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.3riversarchery.com/crusader-youth-longbow.html">Crusader</a> 54" Youth Longbow (20# pull @ 28")</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.3riversarchery.com/titan-recurve-youth-bow.html">Titan</a> 60" Recurve Youth Bow, (29# pull at a 28")</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Both of these bows are nice because they are simple, have low draw weights (necessary for learning proper form while you build strength), and can be used left or right handed. They are not specifically "horse bows" but they are of comparable size.
    </p>

    <p>
      (20# pull @ 28" means that if you pull the bowstring back 28 inches, you will be pulling 20 pounds. If you don't go back all 28 inches -- for example, if you're a child with arms much shorter than -- you'll be pulling less.)
    </p>

    <a name="faq-kit"></a>What other equipment do I need?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      You'll need arrows, a quiver suitable for horse archery, and perhaps a bow case.  You will probably need gloves and/or a thumb ring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arrows can be purchased pre-built or you can buy the individual parts and build your own. Shafts are typically wood, bamboo, or carbon. We recommend carbon for durability and consistency. Do not get arrows meant for modern compound bows; these arrows have plastic vanes instead of feathers and will negatively affect your accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quiver suitable for horse archery holds arrows securely near your hip or leg and allows you to pull and nock quickly while at the same time preventing the arrows from smacking your horse in the rear every stride.  Back quivers are uncommon because they tend to bounce around too much or demand too much time to pull and nock.
    </p>

    <p>
      A bow case is not necessary, but it's a nice addition to a mounted archer's kit. It's just a case for your strung bow that attaches to your saddle.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may desire a bow glove if you find that the fletching is cutting your bow hand.  Likewise, if your bow has a heavier draw weight you may need a glove or a thumb ring, depending on your draw technique, to protect your fingers.
