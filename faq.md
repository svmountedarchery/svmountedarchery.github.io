      Any sport involving a one-ton prey animal has risk involved, but mounted archery is just as safe as any other equestrian discipline. If fact, we think it's safer than most! We shoot at stationary targets and are careful to position them away from hazards. We're careful about desensitizing the horses we use first (it tends to be the sound of the arrow hitting the target, or arrows rattling in a quiver that they mind most).

      Anything you’re comfortable with really. In official MA3 competitions, arrow-rests are prohibited. That being said, a shorter bow is be easier to manage in the saddle. We shoot many arrows at relatively short distances, high poundage bows would be unnecessarily fatiguing. All our members practice mounted archery with traditional Asiatic recurves, a.k.a "horsebows."

      To give you some specifics, here’s what some of our current members use:

      <ul>
        <li>50# @ 30 Hungarian bow</li>
        <li>35# @ 28 Taiga Ragim</li>
        <li>35# @ 31 Ming-4 from Cinnabar bow</li>
      </ul>

      (For those unfamiliar with archery notation: 50# @ 30 means that if you pull the bowstring back 30 inches, you will be pulling 50 pounds. If you don’t go back all 30 inches, you’ll be pulling something less.)

      Come to a BAAA practice to see some of these in person!

      <em>If you’re an archer who’s never been on a horse ...</em> or only gone on a few trail rides while on vacation, we recommend taking a few horseback riding lessons in the ring with an instructor to make sure it’s something you will enjoy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>If you’re an equestrian who’s never shot an arrow ...</em> come to one of our ground archery practices! We have a limited number of loaner bows and arrows for newbies -- contact us if you’re planning on attending so we know to bring them. Or, if the timing never quites works out, most of the ranges have their own instruction programs. They’ll teach modern techniques and use equipment, which is a bit different, but it’ll give you a taste.

      You can also wait for one of our special events, but space is sometimes limited.

      Clubs are sprounting up all over the world! A good place to start your search is the MA3 -- or, if you're not in the Americas, the IHAA. Many clubs have strong Facebook presences, to list only a few: California Centaurs in Petaluma, Broken Arrow Archery (Washington), Rouge Mounted Archers (they hold a yearly international competition in Oregon), Desert Warriors of the Southwest (Arizona).
