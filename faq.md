      Any sport involving over 1,000 pounds of prey animal has risk involved, but mounted archery is just as safe as any other equestrian discipline. If fact, we think it's safer! We practice safe archery and safe horsemanship. We shoot at stationary targets that are positioned out of harm's way. We desensitize the horses to the bow and arrows. When practicing archery from horseback, we start at the walk, then trot, then canter, only moving up in gait when we can safely do so.

      Any sound horse is suitable as long as you are a skillful rider and a dedicated archer.  Breed does not matter.  Some riders definitely prefer certain breeds for their temperament or abilities, but the truth is you can practice and compete in mounted archery on any breed of horse.

      Anything you’re comfortable with really, but traditional Asiatic recurve bows (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_bow">composite bows</a>) often called "horse bows", are the best. In official MA3 competitions, arrow-rests are prohibited. A shorter bow tends to be easier to manage in the saddle. We shoot many arrows at relatively short distances, so high poundage bows are unnecessarily fatiguing. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To give you some specifics, here’s what some of our current members use:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://horsebows.com/bows1.htm#Raven">Kassai Raven</a> (50# @ 30")</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ragim.org/product/traditional-and-hunting-bows/taïga">Ragim Taïga</a> (35# @ 28")</li>
        <li><a href="http://cinnabarbow.com/marinerbows/ming.html">Cinnabar Ming Moon 4 </a> (35# @ 31")</li>
      </ul>

      (For those unfamiliar with archery notation: 50# @ 30" means that if you pull the bowstring back 30 inches, you will be pulling 50 pounds. If you don’t go back all 30 inches, you’ll be pulling less.)

      Come to one of our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mounted-Archery/">Meetups</a> to see some of these in person!

    <p>
      <em>If you’re an archer who’s never been on a horse ...</em> or only gone on a few trail rides while on vacation, we recommend taking a few horseback riding lessons in the ring with an instructor to make sure it’s something you will enjoy and to which you can commit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>If you’re an equestrian who’s never shot an arrow ...</em> come to one of our ground archery practices! They'll be announced on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mounted-Archery/">Meetup Group</a>. We have a limited number of loaner bows and arrows for newbies — let us know if you’re planning on attending so we know to bring them. Or, if the timing never quite works out, most of the ranges have their own instruction programs. They’ll teach using modern techniques and equipment, which is a bit different, but it’ll give you a taste. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also wait for one of our special events, but space may be limited.
