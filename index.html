        We attend the practices of the Bay Area Asian Archers, which are free to attend and open to everyone. They rotate between local public archery ranges including: <a href="http://www.kingsmountainarchers.org/">Kings Mountain Archers</a> in Huddart County Park in Woodside; <a href="http://bhuarchers.org/">Bowhunters Unlimited</a> in Stevens Creek Country Park near Woodside; <a href="http://reboarchers.com/">Redwood Bowman</a> behind the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland; and <a href="http://sfarchers.org/">SF Archers</a> in Pacifica (there's a $5/day fee for this range). Check out the group's <a href="">Google Calendar</a> to see when and where we're meeting next!

        As for horseback riding, we all have individual arrangements. Some of us own horses, some lease, and some take lessons. Our group is currently looking for a place in the area where we can all practice together. While we really hope you'll join us in the search, we also hope you already know about the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cacentaurs">California Centaurs</a>, a <a href="http://www.mountedarchery.org/">Mounted Archery Association of the Americas (MA3)</a> affiliated club based in Petaluma that gives instruction in horseback archery and holds regular practices.
