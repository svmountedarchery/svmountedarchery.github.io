Any culture that had horses and archery practiced horseback archery. From 3,000 years ago to as recently as 200, horseback archery has shaped the course of human history. But its reincarnation as a modern martial art and international sport is very recent history. There are countless resources out there the history of the peoples and regions best known as mounted archers, horses and horseback riding, and traditional archery. Here are some of our member's personal favorites:
