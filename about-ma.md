### The past meets the present

## Ancient martial art
Horse archery is thousands of years old. Across the Eurasian steppe from antiquity to premodern times, survival depended on oneâ€™s skill with horse and bow. The combined use of the horse and the composite recurve bow was common to many of the nomadic inhabitants of Central Asia: Scythians, Huns, Magyars, and Mongols, just to name a few. Further east, Japanese samurai were horsemen as well as swordsmen. And on the Great Plains of North America, the superior speed of the bow over early, slow loading, guns saw horse archery thrive well into the 19th century.

## Modern competitive sport
Today, the modern sport known as mounted archery has been revived in Asia, Europe, and America. Schools of horse archery, founded by Lajos Kassai, have spread from Hungary to the rest of Europe and beyond. In Europe and America, other mounted archery schools and clubs are forming as the sport grows in popularity.
