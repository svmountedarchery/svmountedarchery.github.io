{{ site.title }} is returning to [Indian Hills Ranch](http://indianhillsranch.com/) to lead a meeting of the [Bay View Pony Club](http://www.bayviewponyclub.com/).

In our first visit a year ago we covered the basics of ground archery (Mediterranean draw) and horse desensitization, and concluded with shooting from horseback at the walk. At our return last April, we introduced the thumb draw and practiced shooting from the ground with attention to efficient methods of knocking arrows. We again went through the desensitization process and progressed, as safely possible, to shooting from horseback at the walk or even trot.

For the upcoming session, we'll be refreshing memories and continue to practice and build on the participants' skills.
